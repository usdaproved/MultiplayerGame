## Simple Multiplayer Game
I want this to be as bare bones as possible while still being technically sound.
It will be a multi-threaded program. No libraries, only calling out to windows and D3D12.
A player opens the program, gets a square that they can control, and they are able to see other player's squares move in real time.
That's it.
